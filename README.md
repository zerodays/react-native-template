It embraces uncontrolled components and native HTML inputs, utilizing hooks to optimize re-renders and improve performance. React Hook Form reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to build complex forms while increasing performance compared to traditional form state management practices.

<a name="customizable-components"></a>

## Customizable Components üéÑ

This template includes a set of customizable components that you can use to build your application:

<a name="button"></a>

## Button ‚è©

A highly customizable button component that adopts the variants pattern inspired by `shadcn/ui`, allowing for a consistent yet adaptable design throughout your application.

### Component Explanation

The `Button` component leverages the power of Tailwind CSS with React Native through Nativewind to offer a range of pre-set button styles, termed 'variants'. You can easily extend or customize these styles to fit your design requirements.

Here's a quick rundown on how it works:

- **Variants**: Define the look of your buttons through a `variants` object. Each variant contains styles for the container, text, and optional icon. Variants are applied using the `cn` function from `utils/cn.ts` which ensures proper sorting of Tailwind classes.

- **Animation**: The component uses `react-native-reanimated` to provide feedback when the button is pressed, with a gentle fade-in and move-up effect.

- **Icons**: You can include left and right icons within the button by passing `LucideIcon` components.

- **Feedback Text**: Optionally, you can display a feedback text upon button press, which uses the same animation as the button text.

- **Loading State**: When the `loading` prop is true, the button displays an `ActivityIndicator`.

### How to Use

Simply import and use the `Button` component in your screens or components, selecting the variant you need and passing any required icons or handlers:

```jsx
import Button from '@components/Button';
import { HeartIcon } from 'lucide-react-native';

// ...

<Button
  variant="filled"
  onPress={() => console.log('Button pressed')}
  iconLeft={HeartIcon}>
  Like
</Button>;
```

### Customizing Variants

To create or customize variants, edit the `variants` object within the button component file. Add your styles using the `cn` function for auto-sorting of Tailwind classes:

```javascript
const variants = {
  ...,
  custom: {
    container: cn('rounded-lg bg-custom px-4 py-2'),
    text: cn('font-semibold text-custom-dark'),
    icon: cn('text-custom-dark'),
  },
  ...
};
```

To use your custom variant, just set the `variant` prop on the `Button` component:

```jsx
<Button variant="custom" onPress={...}>
  Custom Button
</Button>
```

By modifying the `Button` component's variants or adding new ones, you can cater to all your button design needs across the application with ease.

<a name="dialog"></a>

## Dialog üó®Ô∏è

A pre-styled `Dialog` component, using a context-based approach to manage its visibility. This component provides an easy way to create and control modal dialogs within your application.

### Component Structure

- **`Dialog`**: Acts as the provider which holds the state and logic for showing and hiding the dialog.
- **`DialogContent`**: The actual modal view that is displayed. It's customizable and can be dismissable.
- **`DialogTrigger`**: A button that toggles the dialog's visibility.
- **`DialogClose`**: A discreet close button usually displayed at the top-right corner of the dialog.
- **`DialogHeader`**: A styled header for your dialog that can hold a title.
- **`DialogFooter`**: A footer for the dialog which can contain buttons for actions like 'cancel' or 'confirm'.
- **`DialogDismissFooter`**: A pre-styled footer with a single button that closes the dialog.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The `Dialog` is set up to manage its state using a context provider, allowing its children to toggle the dialog's visibility without prop drilling.

```jsx
<Dialog>{/* ... */}</Dialog>
```

2. **Displaying Content**: The `DialogContent` wraps the content you want to display inside the modal. It's equipped with a fade-in animation and `KeyboardAvoidingView` to ensure that input fields are always in view.

```jsx
<DialogContent>{/* Your content here */}</DialogContent>
```

3. **Trigger**: Use `DialogTrigger` anywhere within the `Dialog` context to provide a button that can open the dialog.

```jsx
<DialogTrigger variant="default">Open Dialog</DialogTrigger>
```

4. **Closing**: `DialogClose` provides a clickable icon that closes the dialog when pressed.

```jsx
<DialogClose />
```

### Customizing the Dialog

You can customize the dialog by editing the `Dialog`'s variants or adding new ones directly in the component's file, just like the Button component:

```javascript
const DialogVariants = {
  //... define your custom styles
};
```

### Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the `Dialog` in a component:

```jsx
<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger variant="filled">Show Terms of Service</DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>Terms of Service</DialogHeader>
    {/* ... Your terms content */}
    <DialogFooter>
      <DialogClose />
      {/* ... Other action buttons */}
    </DialogFooter>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

This overview should provide you with a good understanding of how to integrate and utilize the `Dialog` component in your application for a variety of modal needs.

## Loading üí´

`Loading` component that provides visual feedback to users during loading states. It's flexible, allowing the choice between a native activity indicator and a more visually rich Lottie animation.

### Component Features

- **Customizable Message**: Display an optional message below the loader to inform users what's happening.
- **Choice of Loader**: Choose between using the native `ActivityIndicator` for a simple loading experience or a Lottie animation for something more engaging.

### How It Works

The `Loading` component checks the `nativeLoader` prop to determine which type of loader to display. It will show a Lottie animation by default. If a `message` is provided, it will be displayed below the loader.

```jsx
<Loading message="Loading your dashboard..." />
```

### Customization

- **Lottie Animation**: You can change the Lottie animation by replacing the `LottieLoader` import with another Lottie file.
- **Message Styling**: Customize the message style by adding Tailwind CSS classes to the `<Text>` component.

### Usage Example

To implement the `Loading` component, import it into your screen or component and add it where you handle your loading logic.

```jsx
import { Loading } from '@components/Loading';

// ...

return isLoading ? (
  <Loading message="Fetching data, please wait..." />
) : (
  // Your content
);
```

With the `Loading` component, you provide a seamless and informative loading experience to your application's users.

<a name="formtextinput"></a>

## FormTextInput üìù

The `FormTextInput` component in the template is a versatile input field designed to work seamlessly with `react-hook-form`. It incorporates features like form context integration, custom icons, and support for different input types including text, number, and multiline text.

### Component Features

- **Integration with `react-hook-form`**: The component is built to automatically hook into the `FormProvider` context, making form state management effortless.
- **Custom Icons**: It supports the inclusion of icons within the text input for a polished look.
- **Multiline Support**: Easily switch between single-line and multiline inputs based on the provided `params`.
- **Display Mode**: A display mode that disables editing, suitable for presenting values in a read-only format.

### How It Works

The `FormTextInput` uses a `Controller` from `react-hook-form` to manage the text input's state and validations. It receives a `name` prop which corresponds to the form field it controls.

### Usage

To use this component, wrap your form in a `FormProvider` and then include `FormTextInput` for each field you need:

```jsx
import { FormProvider } from 'react-hook-form';
import FormTextInput from '@components/FormTextInput';

const formMethods = useForm(); // Initialize react-hook-form methods

// ...

<FormProvider {...formMethods}>
  <FormTextInput
    name="username"
    label="Username"
    icon={UserIcon} // Replace with an actual icon component
    params={{ answerType: 'text' }}
  />
</FormProvider>;
```

### Customizing the TextInput

To customize the text input, pass additional props like `style` for styling and `params` for defining the input's behavior:

```jsx
<FormTextInput
  name="description"
  label="Description"
  params={{ answerType: 'multiline-text' }}
  style={{ ... }}
/>
```

### Custom Icons

Pass your desired icon component through the `icon` prop:

```jsx
import { MailIcon } from 'lucide-react-native';

<FormTextInput name="email" label="Email Address" icon={MailIcon} />;
```

By using `FormTextInput`, form inputs are handled elegantly, providing a streamlined user experience for form interactions.

<a name="validationerror"></a>

## ValidationError üîç

The `ValidationError` component in the template is a dedicated UI element for displaying form validation errors. It integrates with `react-hook-form` and uses internationalization for error messages.

### Component Features

- **Seamless Integration**: Works in conjunction with `react-hook-form` to display validation messages.
- **Internationalization Support**: Utilizes `react-i18next` for translating error messages, making the component ready for multilingual applications.
- **Flexibility**: Offers a `tiny` prop to display a smaller-sized error message, suitable for inline errors or limited space scenarios.

### How It Works

The `ValidationError` component taps into the `FormProvider` context to access the form's error state. It checks if there are any errors associated with the given `name` prop and renders the error message if present.

### Usage

Wrap your form controls within a `FormProvider` and position the `ValidationError` component where you want to display the error message:

```jsx
import { FormProvider } from 'react-hook-form';
import FormTextInput from '@components/FormTextInput';
import ValidationError from '@components/ValidationError';

const formMethods = useForm(); // Initialize react-hook-form methods

// ...

<FormProvider {...formMethods}>
  <FormTextInput
    name="username"
    label="Username"
    // other props
  />
  <ValidationError name="username" />
</FormProvider>;
```

### Customizing the Display

To show a smaller error message, use the `tiny` prop:

```jsx
<ValidationError name="username" tiny />
```

### Wrapping Components with Error Handling

For convenience, you can wrap any form control with `WithValidationError` to include both the input and its validation message:

```jsx
import { WithValidationError } from '@components/ValidationError';

// ...

<WithValidationError name="password">
  <FormTextInput
    name="password"
    label="Password"
    secureTextEntry
    // other props
  />
</WithValidationError>;
```

The `ValidationError` and `WithValidationError` components help maintain a clean UI by only showing error messages when necessary, enhancing the user experience with clear feedback.

- **`/api`**: Houses Zod schemas, API endpoint definitions, and any inferred types.
- **`/utils`**: For reusable logic across the application.
- **`/locales`**: To manage all localization files.
- **`/assets`**: For all static files like images, fonts, and Lottie animations.
- **`/components`**: Split into two distinct subfolders:
  - **`/ui`**: For generic, reusable UI components.
  - **`/[component-name]`**: For large, complex, or specific components like `/sidebar`, `/complex-navbar`, or `/custom-calendar`.

<a name="development-decision-flow-chart"></a

### Development Decision Flow Chart üîÑ

When developing with this template, use the following decision process:

1. **New Screens**: Start by writing code directly in the screen/page file within the `/app` directory.
2. **Component Extraction**: If a piece of UI repeats multiple times within the same screen, extract it as a new component within the same file.
3. **Component Generalization**: Once a component is needed across multiple screens, generalize it and place it in the appropriate `/components` subfolder.

![Flowchart Description](/assets/docs/flow-chart.png)

<a name="benefits-of-this-approach"></a>

### Benefits of This Approach ‚ú®

- **Readability**: Keeping simple, screen-specific components within the screen file makes the code easier to follow.
- **Efficiency**: Components are modularized only when necessary, avoiding premature refactoring.
- **Clarity**: The structure clarifies where each piece of code should reside.
- **Continuous Refinement**: Regularly transitioning components from local to global as needed helps to reduce technical debt.
